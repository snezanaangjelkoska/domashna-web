    <h1>HOBBY</h1>
    <p> I love fashion. I often watch shows and enjoy dressing up, so I decided to start a small business making handmade necklaces, mobile chains, and bracelets from beads and pearls. I had so many ideas and wanted to create fun, stylish pieces that were different from anything else out there. I love bright, colorful things, because I believe color is where our minds and the universe meet. My journey started with a simple love for making unique pieces that show off my personality and style. Each necklace and bracelet is made with care and love, and every one of them is a little celebration of being yourself. I believe the universe is on my side. Trust your inner strength, stay positive, and know that when you believe in yourself, everything starts to fall into place. </p>
